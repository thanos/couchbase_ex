# Couchbase Client Options Assessment

## Executive Summary

This document assesses three approaches for building a Couchbase client for Elixir:
1. **Native Elixir Implementation**
2. **Zigler Wrapper** (wrapping couchbase-zig-client)
3. **Port-based Wrapper** (using couchbase-zig-client as external process)

## Background: Couchbase Client Requirements

A production-ready Couchbase client must support:
- **Key-Value Operations**: GET, SET, UPSERT, DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE
- **Query Operations**: N1QL queries, Full-text search, Analytics
- **Sub-document Operations**: Efficient partial document updates
- **Durability**: Multiple replication levels (Majority, MajorityAndPersistToActive, PersistToMajority)
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling, cluster topology updates
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic, timeout management, circuit breakers
- **Binary Protocol**: Efficient binary memcached protocol implementation
- **Authentication**: SASL, certificate-based auth
- **Compression**: Document compression support

---

## Option 1: Native Elixir Client

### Description
Implement the entire Couchbase client from scratch in pure Elixir/Erlang, including the binary protocol implementation.

### Technical Analysis

#### Pros
[+] **BEAM-Native**: Full integration with OTP supervision trees and error handling
[+] **Safety**: Cannot crash the VM - benefits from BEAM's fault tolerance
[+] **Debuggability**: Full visibility into all operations using Elixir tooling
[+] **No Compilation Dependencies**: Works on any platform supporting Elixir
[+] **Community Accessibility**: Pure Elixir code is approachable for contributors
[+] **Hot Code Reloading**: Can update code without stopping the VM

#### Cons
[-] **Massive Development Effort**: 6-12+ months of full-time development
[-] **Protocol Complexity**: Must implement complete binary memcached protocol
[-] **Performance Overhead**: Network protocol parsing in Elixir is slower than native
[-] **Maintenance Burden**: Must track all Couchbase protocol changes independently
[-] **Feature Parity**: Will lag behind official SDKs in feature support
[-] **No Code Reuse**: Cannot leverage existing battle-tested C/Zig implementations

### Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: ~2-5x slower than native implementations for protocol operations
- **Throughput**: Limited by BEAM's binary parsing performance
- **Memory**: Higher memory usage due to Elixir's immutable data structures
- **Concurrency**: Excellent - can handle 10K+ concurrent connections easily

### Development Estimate
- **Initial MVP**: 3-4 months (basic CRUD operations)
- **Production-ready**: 8-12 months (all features, battle-tested)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: High - must track protocol changes

### Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM-HIGH RISK**
- Protocol implementation bugs could cause data corruption
- Requires deep expertise in binary protocols and Couchbase internals
- Long time-to-market may miss adoption window

## Option 2: Zigler Wrapper (couchbase-zig-client)

### Description
Use Zigler to create Elixir NIFs that wrap the couchbase-zig-client, allowing direct calls to Zig functions from Elixir.

### Technical Analysis

#### Pros
[+] **Best Performance**: Near-native performance (~0.1-1µs call overhead)
[+] **Code Reuse**: Leverages existing couchbase-zig-client implementation
[+] **Fast Development**: 2-4 weeks for basic wrapper
[+] **Type Safety**: Zigler provides automatic type marshaling and safety checks
[+] **Smaller Codebase**: Only need to write Elixir API wrapper
[+] **Automatic Updates**: Easy to pull in upstream Zig client improvements
[+] **Modern Tooling**: Zigler handles NIF boilerplate automatically

#### Cons
[-] **VM Crash Risk**: A bug in Zig code can crash the entire BEAM VM
[-] **Compilation Complexity**: Requires Zig toolchain on deployment systems
[-] **Platform Dependencies**: Must compile for each OS/architecture
[-] **Debugging Difficulty**: Crashes in NIFs provide limited error information
[-] **Scheduler Starvation**: Long-running operations can block BEAM schedulers
[-] **Zig Instability**: Zig hasn't reached 1.0, may have breaking changes

### Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: ~0.1-1µs NIF call overhead (nearly native)
- **Throughput**: Limited only by Couchbase server and network
- **Memory**: Native memory usage (very efficient)
- **Concurrency**: Must use dirty schedulers for blocking operations

### Development Estimate
- **Initial MVP**: 2-3 weeks (basic CRUD operations)
- **Production-ready**: 4-8 weeks (all features, safety mechanisms)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Low - mostly track upstream Zig client changes

### Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM-HIGH RISK**
- VM crashes are unacceptable in production for many teams
- Requires extensive testing and safety mechanisms
- Must implement proper yielding for long operations
- Compilation issues may block some users

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use dirty schedulers for all I/O operations
2. Implement timeouts and resource limits in Zig code
3. Extensive fuzzing and property-based testing
4. Wrapper layer to catch and convert errors safely
5. Documentation on building and testing

## Option 3: Elixir Port (couchbase-zig-client)

### Description
Compile couchbase-zig-client as a standalone executable that communicates with Elixir via stdin/stdout using Ports.

### Technical Analysis

#### Pros
[+] **Maximum Safety**: External process cannot crash the BEAM VM
[+] **Process Isolation**: Full OS-level fault isolation
[+] **Code Reuse**: Leverages existing couchbase-zig-client
[+] **Independent Lifecycle**: Port process can be restarted without affecting VM
[+] **Supervision**: Can use OTP supervisors to monitor and restart ports
[+] **Simpler Distribution**: Ship pre-compiled binaries
[+] **Easier Debugging**: Port crashes don't take down the whole system

#### Cons
[-] **Higher Latency**: ~100-1000µs overhead for IPC (100-1000x slower than NIFs)
[-] **Serialization Overhead**: Must encode/decode all data crossing process boundary
[-] **Complex Protocol**: Need to design efficient communication protocol
[-] **Resource Overhead**: Each port is a separate OS process
[-] **Data Copying**: Cannot share memory, must copy all data
[-] **Backpressure Complexity**: Harder to implement proper flow control

### Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: ~100-1000µs per operation (IPC overhead)
- **Throughput**: Limited by serialization and IPC
- **Memory**: Higher - data copied between processes
- **Concurrency**: Good - can spawn multiple port processes

### Development Estimate
- **Initial MVP**: 3-4 weeks (protocol design + basic operations)
- **Production-ready**: 6-10 weeks (all features, robust error handling)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Low-Medium - protocol maintenance + upstream changes

### Risk Assessment
**LOW-MEDIUM RISK**
- Safest option - port crashes don't affect VM
- Performance may be insufficient for high-throughput scenarios
- Protocol design bugs could cause deadlocks or data loss

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: **Zigler Wrapper (Option 2)**

**Rationale:**

1. **Time to Market**: Can have a working MVP in 2-3 weeks vs 3-4 months
2. **Performance**: Near-native performance is crucial for database operations
3. **Code Quality**: Reuses battle-tested Zig implementation
4. **Maintenance**: Minimal ongoing effort - just track upstream changes
5. **Feature Parity**: Automatic access to all Zig client features

**Risk Mitigation Plan:**

To address the VM crash risk:
1. Use dirty schedulers exclusively for all I/O operations
2. Implement comprehensive timeout mechanisms in the Zig layer
3. Create extensive test suite including property-based testing
4. Add safety wrapper layer in Elixir to validate inputs
5. Implement circuit breakers for automatic fault isolation
6. Provide clear documentation on testing and safety

**Implementation Strategy:**

```elixir
defmodule CouchbaseEx do
  # Public Elixir API - validates inputs, provides safety
  def get(conn, key, opts \\ []) do
    with :ok <- validate_connection(conn),
         :ok <- validate_key(key) do
      # Call Zig NIF via Zigler
      CouchbaseEx.Native.get(conn, key, opts)
    end
  end
end

defmodule CouchbaseEx.Native do
  use Zig,
    otp_app: :couchbase_ex,
    nifs: [...],
    mode: :dirty  # Use dirty schedulers

  # Zig NIFs defined inline or in separate .zig files
end
```

### Alternative Recommendation: **Port-based Wrapper (Option 3)**

**When to Choose This:**

- Your team prioritizes VM stability above all else
- You're operating in a highly regulated environment
- Performance requirements are moderate (< 10K ops/sec)
- You have experience building robust Port protocols

**When NOT to Choose:**

- High-throughput requirements (> 50K ops/sec)
- Low-latency requirements (< 10ms p99)
- Need for high-frequency small operations

### Not Recommended: **Native Elixir (Option 1)**

**Why Not:**

- 10x longer development time with no clear benefits
- Will lag behind official SDKs in features
- Reinventing well-solved problems
- Better to contribute to existing ecosystems

**Only Consider If:**

- You have 6-12 months of dedicated development time
- You have deep Couchbase protocol expertise
- You need absolute platform independence
- You're building for learning/research purposes

---

## Next Steps

### If Choosing Zigler (Recommended):

1. Set up project structure with Zigler dependency
2. Evaluate couchbase-zig-client API and features
3. Design Elixir API that feels idiomatic
4. Implement connection management with dirty schedulers
5. Create basic CRUD operations wrapper
6. Add comprehensive tests and safety mechanisms
7. Document building and deployment

### If Choosing Port:

1. Design communication protocol (recommend: term_to_binary/binary_to_term)
2. Create Zig port executable with stdin/stdout handlers
3. Implement Port manager in Elixir with supervision
4. Add backpressure and flow control mechanisms
5. Test crash recovery and failover scenarios

---

## Conclusion

The **Zigler wrapper approach** offers the best balance of performance, development speed, and maintainability. While it introduces VM crash risks, these can be effectively mitigated with proper safety mechanisms and testing. The ability to deliver a production-ready client in 4-8 weeks vs 8-12 months makes it the clear winner.

The **Port approach** is a solid fallback for teams that cannot accept any VM crash risk, trading ~100x latency overhead for perfect fault isolation.

The **Native Elixir** approach should only be considered if you have significant time and expertise to invest in a long-term project.
